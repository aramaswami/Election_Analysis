# Election_Analysis
## Project Overview
The task assigned to me is to analyze ballots votes from a recent Colorado election and determine the winner, ie. the candidate with the most number of votes. The raw data that I was provided is a csv file with the actual voting data, by ballot, that had the ballot number, county, and candidate for whom the vote was cast. Given the size of the data set, I wrote Python code to analyze file and determine the results of the election. 

I used the following toolsand resources for this assignment:
- Python 3.8
- Visual Studio v1.43.2
- GitBash
- Excel (election results csv file)

## Summary of results
My analysis of election data show the following results

- A total of 369,711 were cast in this election
- The candidates were:
  - Charles Casper Stockham
  - Diana DeGette
  - Raymon Anthony Doane
- The results for each candidate is as follows:
